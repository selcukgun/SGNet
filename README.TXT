SGNet provides network graph visualization including comprehensive representation for optimization models.

I have included the following files:

 sgnet.js        -> SGNet implementation
 network.html    -> Demo page
 raphael.js      -> Raphael library (includes a fix about arc arrow-ends)
 jquery-1.8.1.js -> jQuery framework
